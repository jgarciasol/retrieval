will
be
used
by
scientists
to
help
understand
some
of
the
processes
which
affect
the
earth

is
a
joint
project
of
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
nasa
the
german
space
agency
dara
and
the
italian

asi
it
is
the
next
step
in
a
series
of
spaceborne
imaging
radars
beginning
with
seasat
in
continuing
with
sir
a

it
is
a
precursor
to
the

eos
imaging
radar
system
planned
for
the
end
of
the
decade
science
objectives
sir
sar
unique
contributions
to
earth
observation
and
monitoring
are
its
capability
to
measure
from
space
the
radar
signature
of
the
surface
at
three
different
wavelengths
and
to
make
measurements
for
different
polarizations
at
two
of
those
wavelengths
sir
image
data
will
help
scientists
understand
the
physics
behind
some
of
the
phenomena
seen
in
radar
images
at
just
one
wavelength
polarization
such
as
those
produced
by
seasat
investigators
on
the
sir
sar
science
team
will
use
the
radar
image
data
from
sir
sar
to
make
measurements
of
the
following
vegetation
type
extent
and
deforestation
soil
moisture
content
ocean

wave
and

description
the
sir
sar
antenna
structure
actually
consists
of
three
individual
antennas
one
operating
at
band
cm
wavelength
one
at
band
cm
wavelength
and
the
third
at
band
cm
wavelength
the
band
and
band
antennas
are
constructed
from
separate
panels
that
can
measure
both
horizontal
and
vertical
polarizations
the
sir
sar
antenna
is
the
most
massive
piece
of
hardware
at
a
total
of
kilograms
ever
assembled
at
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
and
measures
meters
by
meters
the
sir
instrument
was
built
by
jpl
and
the
ball
communication
systems
division
for
nasa
and
provides
the
band
and
band
measurements
at
different
polarizations
the
band
and
band
antennas
employ
phased
array
technology
which
allows
the
antenna
beam
pointing
to
be
adjusted
electronically
the
sar
instrument
is
built
by
the
dornier
and
alenia
spazio
companies
for
dara
and
asi
and
operates
at
a
single
frequency
band
the
sar
antenna
is
a
slotted
waveguide
type
which
uses
a
mechanical
tilt
to
change
the
beam
pointing
direction
sir
sar
image
data
during
a
week
long
shuttle
flight
sir
sar
will
image
an
area
of
roughly
million
square
kilometers
of
the
earth
surface
this
corresponds
to
a
total
of
hours
of
data
the
peak
data
rate
will
be
megabits
or
bits
per
second
the
data
collected
will
be
processed
into
images
with
resolution
selectable
from
to
meters
the
width
of
the
area
mapped
out
by
the
radar
will
vary
from
to
kilometers
depending
on
how
the
radar
is
operated
and
the
direction
in
which
the
antenna
beams
are
pointing
data
from
sir
sar
will
be
used
to
develop
automatic
techniques
for
extracting
information
from
radar
image
data
in
preparation
for
the
eos
sar
mission
later
in
the
decade
this
schematic
diagram
shows
the
sir

antennas
illuminating
an
area
on
the
ground
and

out
a
swath
as
the

is
a
cooperative

experiment
between
the
national
aeronautics
and

nasa
the
german

dara
and
the

the

is
the

that
began
with

and
continued
with

in
the

will
eventually
lead
to
topsat
a
mission
to
measure
topography
globally
and
the

later
in
this

the

also
benefits
from

gained
with
the
magellan

international

sir
will
provide
increased
capability
over
seasat
sir
a
and
sir
by
acquiring
digital
images
simultaneously
at
two
microwave
wavelengths
lambda
band
lambda
cm
and
band
lambda
cm
these
vertically
and
horizontally
polarized
transmitted
waves
will
be
received
on
two
separate
channels
so
that
sir
will
provide
images
of
the
magnitude
of
radar
backscatter
for
four
polarization
combinations
hh
horizontally

vertically
received
hv
and

and
also
data
on
the

difference
between

this
allows
derivation
of
the
complete
scattering
matrix
of
a
scene
on
a
pixel
by
pixel
basis
from
this
scattering
matrix
every
polarization
configuration
linear
circular
or
elliptical
can
be
generated
during
ground
processing
the
radar
polarimetric
data
will
yield
more

about
the

germany
imaging
radar
program
started
with
the
microwave
remote

experiment
mrse
flown
aboard
the
shuttle
this
band
radar
was
flown
on
the
first
spacelab
mission
in
the
program
was
continued
by
development
of
the
sar
for
which
cooperation
with
italy
was
initiated
sar
will
operate
at
band
lambda
cm
with
vv
polarization
resulting
in
a
three
frequency
capability
for
the
total
sir
sar
system
because
radar
backscatter
is
most
strongly
influenced
by
objects
comparable
in
size
to
the
radar
wavelength
this
multi
frequency
capability
will
provide
information
about
the
earth
surface
over
a
wide
range
of
scales
not
discernible
with
previous
single
wavelength
experiments
sir
sar
instrumentation
sir
will
provide
multi
frequency
multi
polarization
radar
data
the
sir
instrument
is
composed
of
several
subsystems
the
antenna
array
the
transmitter
the
receivers
the
data
handling
subsystem
and
the
ground
sar
processor
the
antenna
is
composed
of
two
planar
arrays
one
for
band
and
one
for
band
each
array
is
composed
of
a
uniform
grid
of
dual
polarized
microstrip
antenna
radiators
with
each
polarization
port
fed
by
a
separate
corporate
feed
network
the
overall
size
of
the
sir
antenna
is
meters
and
consists
of
three
leaves
each
divided
into
four
subpanels
model
of
the
sir
sar
antenna
unlike
previous
sir
missions
the
sir
radar
beam
is
formed
from
hundreds
of
small
low
power
solid
state
transmitters
embedded
in
the
surface
of
the
radar
antenna
by
properly
phasing
the
energy
from
these
transmitters
the
beam
can
be
electronically
steered
in
the
range
direction
deg
from
the
nominal
deg
off
nadir
position
without
physically
moving
the
large
radar
antenna
this
feature
will
enable
images
to
be
acquired
over
a
wide
range
of
incidence
angles
sar
will
provide
vv
polarization
images
using
a
passive
slotted
waveguide
antenna
measuring
meters
other
sar
components
include
a
traveling
wave
tube
as
transmitter
an
exciter
receiver
and
data
handling
subsystem
a
mechanical
tilt
mechanism
will
point
the
sar
antenna
to
angles
between
and
deg
in
the
same
direction
as
the
band
and
band
beams
both
sir
and
sar
can
be
operated
as
either
stand
alone
radars
or
together
roll
and
yaw
maneuvers
of
the
shuttle
will
allow

to
be
acquired
on
either

of
the

nadir
ground
track
the
width
of
the

swath
on

varies
from
